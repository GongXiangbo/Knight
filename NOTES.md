# Extension Ideas: Knight Path as a Reinforcement Learning Problem

The current knight path finder uses classical algorithms to find all shortest paths. We could extend this into an interesting reinforcement learning problem that could potentially handle more complex scenarios. Here's how:

## Why Reinforcement Learning?

The knight's movement problem is perfect for reinforcement learning because:

1. It has a clearly defined state space (positions on the board)
2. A clear set of actions (valid knight moves)
3. Well-defined rewards (reaching target position)
4. Deterministic state transitions (perfect for initial learning)

## Proposed Extension Architecture

### 1. Core Components

- **Environment**: The chessboard with various obstacles/weights
- **Agent**: A reinforcement learning model (e.g., DQN or PPO)
- **State**: Current position + target position
- **Actions**: Valid knight moves
- **Reward**: Distance reduction to target, penalties for illegal moves

### 2. Implementation Plan

1. Create a distributed training pipeline using Docker Compose:
   - Training service (model training)
   - Environment service (board simulation)
   - Monitoring service (metrics and visualization)

2. AWS Integration:
   - Store trained models in S3
   - Use SageMaker for training
   - Deploy API on Lambda for inference

### 3. Real-world Applications

This extension could be useful for:
- Pathfinding in games with complex movement rules
- Robot motion planning in constrained spaces
- Strategy optimization in chess engines

The beauty of this approach is that it combines multiple required topics (Python, RL, AWS, Docker, distributed architectures) into a cohesive system while building upon the existing codebase.
